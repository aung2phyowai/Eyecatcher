v0.0.6 19/10/2017


Problems noted with v0.0.5:
> patients getting stuck on calibration screen (faces not disappearing)
> figure outputs have to be saved manually
> no confirmation of which eye is being tested

Changes made in v0.0.6:
* Sped up load time (set skipWriteCheck to false)
* Further relaxed the calibClassifier to reduce number of times get 'stuck' on the face
* make 'both' option trigger 2 tests (left eye, right eye, in random order)
* Shifted to PsychTestRig v0.8 (allows for fewer config files)
* save output image automatically, with date and time and patient number
* Add title to figure, confirming date, time, and patient number
* set IN_FINAL_MODE = true
* changed desired viewing distance to 53 cm (previously 60 cm)
* removed some redundant lines of code
* corrected some comments and numbering
* add an indicator to confirm the eye on distance calibration screen (and desired distance)
* CALIBRATION: Now trigger recalibration only if missing a very large number of points (> 90% after 10+ trials; previously > 65% after 5+ trials)
* CALIBRATION: Can manually trigger recalibration by pressing "t"
* CALIBRATION: Add start option to cancel calibration altogether
* CALIBRATION: Added key ("SPACE") to 'force' a particular calibration point to register
